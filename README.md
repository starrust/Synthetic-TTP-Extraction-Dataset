This repository contains a synthetic dataset for automated extraction and reasoning of TTPs from threat reports. The dataset was generated as part of the work presented in the CSCWD2025 paper:
"From Threat Report to ATT&CK: Automated Extraction and Reasoning of TTPs Using Large Language Models."

## Overview
The dataset is built on two foundational datasets: the ATT&CK Procedure dataset and the TRAM dataset. These were enhanced using a two-step synthesis process to address data imbalance and to include explanatory rationales for each entry.
